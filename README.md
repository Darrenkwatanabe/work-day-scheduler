## Description

[Try out the Work Day Scheduler](https://darrenkwatanabe.github.io/work-day-scheduler/)

This website features a work day scheduler for users to plan out their days in an organized matter. They can input whatever task they have to 
do in each time block and save that onto the webpage. The time blocks will also be color coded to help show the user what time has past, what 
is in the present and future. The current date will always be displayed at the top of the page as well. 

## Usage

First, the webpage will be displayed with the current date.

Then the user will be allowed to input whatever they would like into each time block and also be allowed to save that input to the webpage using
the save button on the right hand side of the time block.

## Learning Points

1. Utilizing JQuery libraries
2. Learned how to compare current times with times shown on a scheduler
3. Learned how to display the current time on a webpage using the Day.js library

This project was very interesting on how we were able to load a page and have the time blocks correspond with the current time depending on their
time block. I had ran into trouble with calling the correct classes and had to check multiple times because of the errors I had been experiencing 
on my webpage.
